- Keep page-level components in `src/pages/` or main `src/`
- Use proper TypeScript typing for all props and state
- Implement responsive design principles

## Focus Areas

This portfolio should demonstrate:

- Modern React patterns and hooks usage
- TypeScript proficiency
- Responsive design skills
- Component-based architecture
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Frontend performance optimization
